Jake Davis, former Anonymous and LulzSec hacker, shares his hacker journey while exploring just what makes hackers tick&#8230;<!--more-->

  


## Whos is Jake Davis?

An 18-year-old man suspected of being Topiary was arrested in the Shetland islands of Scotland on July 27, 2011. On July 31, 2011, the man was charged with five offences including unauthorised computer access and conspiracy to carry out a distributed denial of service attack on the Serious Organised Crime Agency&#8217;s website. Scotland Yard later identified the man arrested as Jake Davis, a resident of the island of Yell.

He was charged with unauthorised access of a computer under the Computer Misuse Act 1990, encouraging or assisting criminal activity under the Serious Crime Act 2007, conspiracy to launch a denial-of-service attack against the Serious Organised Crime Unit contrary to the Criminal Law Act 1977, and criminal conspiracy also under the Criminal Law Act 1977.

Police confiscated a Dell laptop and a 100-gigabyte hard drive that had 16 different virtual machines. The hard drive also contained details relating to an attack on Sony and hundreds of thousands of email addresses and passwords. A London court released Davis on bail under the conditions that he live under curfew with his mother and have no access to the Internet.

His lawyer Gideon Cammerman stated that, while his client did help publicise LulzSec and Anonymous attacks, he lacked the technical skills to have been anything but a sympathiser.

After his arrest, Anonymous launched a &#8216;Free Topiary&#8217; campaign, which included adding a &#8220;Free Topiary&#8221; banner to their Twitter avatars, similar to the Free Bradley banner.
